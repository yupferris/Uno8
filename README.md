Uno8
====

A Chip-8 emulator written in Uno.

Written by Jake "Ferris" Taylor using Uno and Realtime Studio ( http://outracks.com )

NOTE: All of the games included in this package were NOT written by me, but were released in the public domain under, from what I could tell, no visible license. So, I'm including them in here because why not.
